## Introduction

Statistical tests are essential tools in data analysis and hypothesis testing. This Jupyter Notebook explores two commonly used statistical tests: the hypergeometric test and Pearson's chi-squared test. These tests help analyze data and make inferences about populations based on sample data.

## Fisher's Test

The hypergeometric test is a statistical test used to determine the probability of drawing a specific number of successes from a finite population without replacement. This test is often used in situations where the sample size is small, and it's necessary to calculate probabilities based on fixed marginal totals using the hypergeometric distribution.

## Pearson's Chi-Squared Test

Pearson's chi-squared test examines the divergence of observed frequencies from expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of no association. It uses the chi-squared distribution as an approximation. In many practical applications, especially with large samples, the hypergeometric and chi-squared tests may lead to similar conclusions. However, differences become more noticeable with smaller samples or when expected cell counts are low.

## Usage
